jquery.observable
=================

This plugin converts a data structure built from javascript objects and arrays
into an observable structure with jQuery-style accessors and event listeners.

The aim of this project is to provide a tool for front-end developers
to effectively handle their data model, with the power of event handling
in the model, but without the need of writing tons of accessor methods.

The project is currently in proof-of-concent status.
